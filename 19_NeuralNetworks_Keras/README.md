This folder contains notebooks on Tensorflow & Keras.
These notebooks were created following the courses by Jos√© Marcial Portilla on Udemy;
among these courses are:
- Complete Tensorflow 2 and Keras Deep Learning Bootcamp
- Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning

In particular, the notebooks on CNNs using Keras are located in two folders; the first and most basic is a link to

`git_repositories/templates/opencv/python/08_Keras_Deep_Learning`.

The second is another folder with more examples.
